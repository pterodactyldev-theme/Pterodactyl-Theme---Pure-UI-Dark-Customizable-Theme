Hello,

Today I propose a customized Pterodactyl theme (Pure UI Dark) that took me several hours of work. This is a theme based on the classic, but fully customized with the login page completely rebuilt.

This theme is compatible with 0.7.15 version of Pterodactyl.

You now have the opportunity to customize your theme as you see fit! Indeed, recently, two configuration files have made their appearance so that you can change the colors of the theme and the background of the home page!
Of course, all the explanations you need are in a text file when downloading.

I propose to view some screens:

<a href="http://zupimages.net/viewer.php?id=19/44/4taa.png"><img src="https://zupimages.net/up/19/44/4taa.png" alt="" /></a>

Installation:
1. Upload the files to /var/www/pterodactyl and overwrite the folders.
2. Run the following commands on your machine (still in: /var/www/pterodactyl):
° $ >> php artisan cache:clear
° $ >> php artisan view:clear (if it does not work with the first)

Thank you HooĸDoɴɴ_ for allowing me to share the theme.
